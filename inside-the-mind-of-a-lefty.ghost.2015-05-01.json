Balance of Creation & Consumption","slug":"the-balance-of-creation-consumption","markdown":"All of my life I have greatly enjoyed the act of consumption. It is as simple as opening our eyes to see colors, listening to the soft sounds floating past our ears, sticking out our tongues to taste a lemon, using our noses to guess what our Mom is cooking, or reaching out our hands to feel our surroundings. We are born with a desire to learn and understand what we don't yet know. \n\nBut there is another side to consumption that a lot of people take for granted. Things that you consume must be created first. Without something or someone creating things around you, you would have nothing to consume *(or at the least you would have to create it yourself)*.\n\n### Imagination to Designer\n\nAs far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to create. I wasn't the best at creating, so I chose to figure out how things were made. Much to my parents dismay, I took apart every electronic toy I was given. More times than not I forgot the order of taking it apart and ended up with a broken toy. What I learned from this process is that people spend a great amount of time to create something to work correctly, but it takes minutes to destroy it.\n\n[![Creative Circus](/content/images/2014/Jan/circus_logo.jpg)](http://www.creativecircus.edu/)\n\nBack in 2006 I enrolled at [The Creative Circus](http://www.creativecircus.edu/) for the *Design* track. This was one of the best choices I have made in my life, even though it is not my central focus currently. The first person I think of when talking about that school is Sylvia Gaffney. She was my color theory teacher, and she was merciless. I learned why creation was more than just puting two items together to make a finished product. To be able to create, you must have a desire, passion, and understanding of the product you are creating. In Sylvia's class, she doesn't ask you to discover those things. She makes you do unbearable amounts of homework to find them while drowning. You begin to understand the product as you work through each part and discover its needs and potential. As a result, passion and desire begin to build as you discover the meaning behind the product. I now have a passion for design and always look for meaning behind what I create.\n\n### Designer to Developer\n\nAs I walked out of The Creative Circus, I had an opportunity to join a small design/development studio, [Hybrid](http://www.meethybrid.com/) *(known as Hybr-id Design at the time)*. I would not be in the position I am in without this company or more importantly the guy who ran it, [Chip Lay](https://twitter.com/chiplay). Starting out as a designer I got to create web layouts and experiences. Over time I gave in to my urge to learn how the websites were built. Given the flexibility and relaxed environment at Hybrid, I was able to pursue learning code. \n\n[![Hybrid](/content/images/2014/Jan/hybrid_logo.jpg)](http://www.meethybrid.com/)\n\nI want to note that I learned code differently than most. Most choose to read books and go to computer classes to figure out what the code does as a product. Being a designer I went backwards. I looked at design as the product and the code would be enhancing it. In this manner the design was my passion and the code would help me understand the design better. Looking back, I would attribute this style of learning to the speed in which I was able to learn. I also believe that my childhood desire to figure out how things work bleed into my ease and persistence of learning.\n\n[![Big Nerd Ranch](/content/images/2014/Jan/bnr_logo.jpg)](http://www.bignerdranch.com/)</center>\n\nNow, there is only so much that you can learn on your own. And even worse, what you are learning by yourself is not always right. So when I got the chance to take a class at [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/), I jumped at it. Hybrid sent me to a 5 day iOS Bootcamp class that rocked my world. What I had taken a year+ to learn was made so clear after going through that class. There is something so necessary about learning from a human who can personally interact with you.\n\n### Developer to Teacher\n\nI noted in the beginning that there is no consumption without creation. For the past 8+ years I have been consuming very valuable knowledge. And yet, I have mostly created things that benefit me. I rave about the open source community, yet my [Github](https://github.com/joalbright) public repos are lame. I have hit a point where I have a huge desire to give back.\n\n[![The Iron Yard](/content/images/2014/Jan/tiy_logo.jpg)](http://theironyard.com)</center>\n\nI'm excited to say that I will be able to do that as the Atlanta [iOS instructor](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/) at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com). After spending a great week with TIY team in Greenville, I have gained an even greater excitement for the role I am allowed to play. [Mason Stewart](https://twitter.com/masondesu) has pioneered a style of teaching that makes knowledge even more consumable than many other that have come before him. It is a great honor to be able to help create this new culture of learning.\n\n### Creation == Consumption\n\nAs I look forward, my pursuit will be to balance out how much I consume with how much I create. Not only will I be adding 10+ new public repos to my Github in the next couple months, I plan on taking an active part in major community based repos as well.\n\nWhat will you choose to do? Consume? Create?\n\n<style>\nimg { max-width: 150px; }\n</style>","html":"<p>All of my life I have greatly enjoyed the act of consumption.

I have hit a point where I have a huge desire to give back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://theironyard.com\"><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jan/tiy_logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Iron Yard\" title=\"\" /></a></center></p>\n\n<p>I'm excited to say that I will be able to do that as the Atlanta <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/\">iOS instructor</a> at <a href=\"http://theironyard.com\">The Iron Yard</a>. After spending a great week with TIY team in Greenville, I have gained an even greater excitement for the role I am allowed to play. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/masondesu\">Mason Stewart</a> has pioneered a style of teaching that makes knowledge even more consumable than many other that have come before him. It is a great honor to be able to help create this new culture of learning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"creationconsumption\">Creation == Consumption</h3>\n\n<p>As I look forward, my pursuit will be to balance out how much I consume with how much I create. Not only will I be adding 10+ new public repos to my Github in the next couple months, I plan on taking an active part in major community based repos as well.</p>\n\n<p>What will you choose to do? Consume? Create?</p>\n\n<style>  \nimg { max-width: 150px; }  \n</style>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-01-18T04:24:42.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-01-22T16:59:11.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-01-18T06:40:28.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":3,"uuid":"022005b4-0dea-4d04-881f-6561e72be31a","title":"Competition, A Necessary Evil","slug":"competition-a-necessary-evil","markdown":"When I see an online contest, my first reaction is to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction.

I have been impressed with what the Treehouse's team has been doing with their online training service.\n\n[![Team Treehouse](/content/images/2014/Jan/treehouse_logo.jpg)](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-calculator-app-for-ios)\n\nThe details for the app contest :\n\n- Build an app that is based on Apple's calculator \n- Make the addition button work\n- Due by January 19th *(tomorrow as I am writing this)*\n- Post it on [Github](https://github.com/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)\n\nLet the competition ensue. :)\n\n### Research \n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Calculator App Icon](/content/images/2014/Jan/calc.png)\n</div>\n\nI spent a while testing what happens when using the Apple calculator in different ways. Below are a few tests :\n\n*[button] display*\n\n- [3] 3 [+] 3 [5] 5 [=] 8 [=] 13 [=] 18\n- [4] 4 [%] 0.04\n- [3] 3 [-] 3 [1] 1 [+] 2 [4] 4 [x] 4 [3] 3 [=] 14\n- [4] 4 [.] 4. [5] 4.5 [+] 4.5 [3] 3 [=] 7.5\n\n### Functionality\n\nI spent a good chunk of time trying to get it as close to working like the original app. Here is what I was able to get working :\n\n- math operations [+], [-], [x], [/]\n- percent ... [4] 4 [%] 0.04\n- signing ... [4] 4 [+/-] -4\n- clear / all clear ... [4] 4 [c] 0 and [ac] clears last operation\n- decimal ... [4] 4 [.] 4. [6] 4.6\n- equals after operation ... [4] 4 [+] 4 [4] 4 [=] 8 [=] 12\n- operation after operation ... [4] 4 [+] 4 [3] 3 [-] 7 [2] 2 [=] 5\n\nI always get annoyed when I accidentally hit the wrong number while in the middle of a multi-step formula. So I chose to add a \"delete\" button that removes numbers if they have just been input. It does not delete if the display is a result.\n\n- delete ... [4] 4 [5] 45 [del] 4 [del] 0\n\n### Design & Experience\n\nSpecifications I wanted to follow :\n\n- works for both 3.5 & 4 inch displays\n- simple iOS 7 look with better touch and selected animations\n- resizable font size for display (like the original app)\n- design that will be dynamic for future ability to customize\n- discover and use original font\n\nMy biggest design challenge was the font**(s)**. Yes, that is plural. Apple uses the Helvetica Neue family for most of there thin [fonts in iOS 7](http://iosfonts.com/). But the funny thing is the decimal point in [Helvetica Neue](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/) is a line, not a circle. So I went about finding a good decimal and I ended up using [Avenir](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/). The button was easy, the display was a little trickier. I setup a simple [NSMutableAttributedString](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/classes/NSMutableAttributedString_Class/Reference/Reference.html) to solve the display issue.\n\nI wanted to have a nerdy throwback. So I based the icon on [calculator speak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_spelling). When you put 1337 in a calculator and turn it upside down it spells LEEt (as in an elite nerd).\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![1337 App Icon](/content/images/2014/Jan/leet_icon.png)\n</div>\n\nHere are the screenshots of the calculator app that I built.\n\n<div class=\"screen_shots\">\n![Launch Image](/content/images/2014/Jan/leet_launch.jpg)\n![Screen Shot](/content/images/2014/Jan/leet_ss.jpg)\n![Screen Shot](/content/images/2014/Jan/leet_ss2.jpg)\n</div>\n\n### Project Links\n\n- [Github - 1337 Calc](https://github.com/joalbright/1337-Calc)\n- [Treehouse Contest Entry](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-calculator-app-for-ios#featurette-241)\n- [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/)\n\nWish me luck!\n\n<style>\nimg { max-width: 150px; }\n.screen_shots img { max-width: 30%; display:inline-block; }\n.icon img { width:80px; border-radius:21px; border: 1px solid #eee;  display:inline; }\n</style>","html":"<p>When I see an online contest, my first reaction is to run as fast as possible in the opposite direction.

If no one chose to share their knowledge and experiences with others, everyone would just make the same mistakes and discover the same things. The lack of learning from the past slows down humanity's progress greatly. Just like everything else evolves as obstacles come along, education needs to evolve to match the speed of technology.\n\n## The Problem\n\nGoing through school in my generation we were using books that were 5 - 10 years old, and that was based on the publication date. Those books could have easily taken 1 - 2 years to write and put together. Current school systems have newer books that are 1 - 2 years old + the amount of time to put them together. Even if you get a book that was just written it will be out of date in a couple months to a year. So, how do we teach current and future knowledge?\n\n## The Solution\n\nAfter joining [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com), I started to brainstorm around what they are currently doing and how I could expand upon it. The curriculum setup now is very fluid and open to manipulation as the class goes along. Currently we have notes about what is taught in a [Github](http://github.com) repo. Im hoping to open it up with more information about how we will cover sections and when. Basically a textbook as a repo.\n\n#### The Experiment\n\nI will be building TIY's iOS curriculum on a public facing Github repo. This will allow for some very interesting interactions :\n\n- Instant updates as technology improves or is created\n\t- ex: a new library, framework, or API is created... so I change tomorrow's lesson to cover it\n    - students graduating with up-to-date technologies is so desirable \n- Feature requests\n\t- ex : a student requests to learn a particular technology within the iOS community\n    - ex : a company asks for students to learn a technology for job placement\n- Pull requests to allow for instructor collaboration on the curriculum\n- Bug requests to allow for holes or issues that might arise in the curriculum\n\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg for what will be able to come out of a repo based curriculum. Once I have the repo setup, I will update this entry with a link to it.\n\n#### Signup for curriculum updates :\n\n<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nform input[type=\"email\"], form input[type=\"text\"] { border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 5px 10px; margin: 0px 0px 5px; }\nform input[type=\"submit\"] { background: #aaa; border-radius: 6px; margin: 0; border: none; padding: 10px 10px; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; text-transform: uppercase; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"mc_embed_signup\">\n<form action=\"http://jo2.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=d12b1925febc68400a99bb4e1&amp;id=93ccdd9884\" method=\"post\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" target=\"_blank\" novalidate>\n\t<input type=\"email\" value=\"\" name=\"EMAIL\" class=\"email\" id=\"mce-EMAIL\" placeholder=\"email address\" required>\n    <!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups-->\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"b_d12b1925febc68400a99bb4e1_93ccdd9884\" value=\"\"></div>\n\t<div class=\"clear\"><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"subscribe\" id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button\"></div>\n</form>\n</div>\n\n<!--End mc_embed_signup-->\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/9161595@N03/5702488800/\">Chris Devers</a> via <a href=\"http://compfight.com\">Compfight</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>","html":"<p><img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jan/library.jpg\" alt=\"Library\" /></p>\n\n<p>Education is how the world develops and progresses.

Our potential is limitless, yet many of us choose to settle for what is necessary. This leaves the human race to just putter along waiting for aliens to come and conquer us (sorry, my nerdy side comes out a lot).\n\n#### An Exception to the Rule\n\nEven though most humans are happy with just cruising through life. There are a select few who choose to make a difference. This group is made up of people who lead, inspire, innovate, & most of all create. Some people are born with these skills, while others grow a passion to be more.\n\n#### First Hand Experience\n\nI have worked in both good and bad business environments. And I believe that each working environment is created and molded by those who work around you. One of the first jobs that I worked at when I was younger had one boss who never was around, a second boss who did nothing on the job, me and two other guys who worked hard, and one last guy who hung out with the boss that didn't work. I stayed at that company for six months before I lost all desire to work there. [Hybrid](http://meethybrid.com), another company that I worked for was smaller, with just a couple guys working alongside me and even my boss, [Chip Lay](http://twitter.com/chiplay), was in the trenches constantly working his butt off to get the job done.\n\n## The Iron Yard\n\nWhen I first heard about [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com), I was intrigued with their setup. Being a flat company, there is no managers or bosses. This means that every employee needs to be a self-starter and must be able to handle the responsibility of getting the job done. Basically, if TIY was made up of people who only chose to do the bare minimum possible, the company would have failed already. Thankfully, that is not the case.\n\nIt is very rare to have multiple employees who are MVPs, but being a part of a team made completely of MVPs is an epic experience.\n\n#### Meeting the Team\n\nThis past week, I got to hang out in Greenville to meet everyone and see how the flagship is ran. It is so impressive to see what can be built by just a few people. Peter, Eric, Mason, Aubrey & the rest of [the team](http://theironyard.com/about/team/) have created an amazing foundation for this company to expand upon. Even more impressive is that each member employed by TIY is really passionate about TIY's mission. If you take a step back, our whole team looks like a fantasy football (or your favorite sport here) team. Each player with incredible stats for their area of expertise.\n\n## New Campuses\n\nNow that The Iron Yard has created a template for a strong campus, we are tasked with creating campuses in places of need. I am very honored to be apart of this invaluable experience.\n\n#### Atlanta\n\nAs the first [iOS instructor](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/) of The Iron Yard, I will be pioneering the curriculum for our academy. I am also excited about getting to work along side two other instructors teaching [Rails](http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/) & [Front End](http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/) Engineering. We have a Rails instructor, but are still looking for a Front End instructor. You can easily [apply here](http://theironyard.com/jobs/) to join our fast growing team.\n\nI have been following, [John Saddington](http://john.do/about/), for awhile now because of his many accomplishments. And when he came to me with an offer to work for TIY, I didn't have to think very hard for an answer. Yes working with the rest of the TIY crew is going to be amazing, but I am very excited to be working beside this man as we start the [Atlanta campus](http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/). He desires to pursue his full potential 24/7, and you can see it in what he does. This isn't limited to his job, he is an awesome family man as well.\n\n#### Charleston\n\nWhile up in Greenville, I got to meet the two instructors who will be starting up the [Charleston campus](http://theironyard.com/locations/charleston/). I have really solid teammates around me to lean on as I need them. [Nick Bucciarelli](https://twitter.com/n_bucciarelli) is a very smart engineer for his age, only 25 and he is passionate about leading others into careers of development. [Calvin Webster](https://twitter.com/calweb) will be one of the more foundational teachers, based on the fact that he was born with a skill to guide & teach others. Calvin & Nick are going to be an incredibly strong team who I have no doubt will build an amazing campus together.\n\n#### More to Come\n\nThe heart and soul of TIY is to create exceptional value to our communities, with hopes that it will allow others to grow and succeed. So as we create awesome environments in these new cities, many more will be continuously dreamed up. I can't wait to see what kind of impact we will have made by the end of 2014.\n","html":"<p>Being human, we have many opportunities to be much more incredible than we choose to be.

This leaves the human race to just putter along waiting for aliens to come and conquer us (sorry, my nerdy side comes out a lot).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"anexceptiontotherule\">An Exception to the Rule</h4>\n\n<p>Even though most humans are happy with just cruising through life. There are a select few who choose to make a difference. This group is made up of people who lead, inspire, innovate, &amp; most of all create. Some people are born with these skills, while others grow a passion to be more.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"firsthandexperience\">First Hand Experience</h4>\n\n<p>I have worked in both good and bad business environments. And I believe that each working environment is created and molded by those who work around you. One of the first jobs that I worked at when I was younger had one boss who never was around, a second boss who did nothing on the job, me and two other guys who worked hard, and one last guy who hung out with the boss that didn't work. I stayed at that company for six months before I lost all desire to work there. <a href=\"http://meethybrid.com\">Hybrid</a>, another company that I worked for was smaller, with just a couple guys working alongside me and even my boss, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chiplay\">Chip Lay</a>, was in the trenches constantly working his butt off to get the job done.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"theironyard\">The Iron Yard</h2>\n\n<p>When I first heard about <a href=\"http://theironyard.com\">The Iron Yard</a>, I was intrigued with their setup. Being a flat company, there is no managers or bosses. This means that every employee needs to be a self-starter and must be able to handle the responsibility of getting the job done. Basically, if TIY was made up of people who only chose to do the bare minimum possible, the company would have failed already. Thankfully, that is not the case.</p>\n\n<p>It is very rare to have multiple employees who are MVPs, but being a part of a team made completely of MVPs is an epic experience.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"meetingtheteam\">Meeting the Team</h4>\n\n<p>This past week, I got to hang out in Greenville to meet everyone and see how the flagship is ran. It is so impressive to see what can be built by just a few people. Peter, Eric, Mason, Aubrey &amp; the rest of <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/about/team/\">the team</a> have created an amazing foundation for this company to expand upon. Even more impressive is that each member employed by TIY is really passionate about TIY's mission. If you take a step back, our whole team looks like a fantasy football (or your favorite sport here) team. Each player with incredible stats for their area of expertise.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"newcampuses\">New Campuses</h2>\n\n<p>Now that The Iron Yard has created a template for a strong campus, we are tasked with creating campuses in places of need. I am very honored to be apart of this invaluable experience.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"atlanta\">Atlanta</h4>\n\n<p>As the first <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/\">iOS instructor</a> of The Iron Yard, I will be pioneering the curriculum for our academy. I am also excited about getting to work along side two other instructors teaching <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/\">Rails</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/academy/front-end-engineering/\">Front End</a> Engineering. We have a Rails instructor, but are still looking for a Front End instructor. You can easily <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/jobs/\">apply here</a> to join our fast growing team.</p>\n\n<p>I have been following, <a href=\"http://john.do/about/\">John Saddington</a>, for awhile now because of his many accomplishments. And when he came to me with an offer to work for TIY, I didn't have to think very hard for an answer. Yes working with the rest of the TIY crew is going to be amazing, but I am very excited to be working beside this man as we start the <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/\">Atlanta campus</a>. He desires to pursue his full potential 24/7, and you can see it in what he does. This isn't limited to his job, he is an awesome family man as well.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"charleston\">Charleston</h4>\n\n<p>While up in Greenville, I got to meet the two instructors who will be starting up the <a href=\"http://theironyard.com/locations/charleston/\">Charleston campus</a>. I have really solid teammates around me to lean on as I need them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/n_bucciarelli\">Nick Bucciarelli</a> is a very smart engineer for his age, only 25 and he is passionate about leading others into careers of development. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/calweb\">Calvin Webster</a> will be one of the more foundational teachers, based on the fact that he was born with a skill to guide &amp; teach others. Calvin &amp; Nick are going to be an incredibly strong team who I have no doubt will build an amazing campus together.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"moretocome\">More to Come</h4>\n\n<p>The heart and soul of TIY is to create exceptional value to our communities, with hopes that it will allow others to grow and succeed. So as we create awesome environments in these new cities, many more will be continuously dreamed up.

This has intimidated a lot of developers from even getting into app development.\n\nI want to clear a few things up about what goes into app development.\n\n### Know Code\n\nObviously, you first need an interest in programming, a desire to learn how things are built, or have a passion to create. Without one of those app development is just going to be a painful experience. The language can be taught through online tutorials like [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) or through in class courses like [Mobile Engineering](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/). There is a huge time difference between learning from a person (my class above is 12 weeks) and learning from online tutorials (which can take 1 - 2 years).\n\n### Build\n\nOnce you know how to write basic code (c or objective-c), the build gets exponentially easier. [Apple](http://apple.com) has done a great job improving Xcode (*current version 5.0.2*) over time. Using interface builder you can drag and drop elements like buttons, images and more to quickly layout your app. After that you might add a couple connections with code to make the interface functional. And **BOOM**, you are done. Yes, some apps will take more than a day (*especially game apps*). I just built [1337 Calc](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1337-calc/id799510809?ls=1&mt=8) in [one day](http://blog.jo2.co/competition-a-necessary-evil/) last week and it does about 98% of what the *portrait* version of Apple's calculator app can do.\n\n### Testing\n\nTesting was a pain until companies like [TestFlight](https://testflightapp.com/) came along and made the process very fluid. Now you send people to TestFlight, they signup & register their device, you add their device to the Apple portal, build your app through Xcode, and upload the build to Tesflight. They get an email that has a link to download the app to their device. You can now let your Grandma test the app out from 5 states away. :)\n\n### Submission\n\nIt used to be a huge hassle to submit your app, and the 2+ week* wait for you app to get reviewed was killer. Now all you have to do is, setup details about your app in iTunesConnect, then submit the app through Xcode. Then you just wait for email updates about your submission progress. I submitted the 1337 Calc app on January 17th and it was reviewed and approved on the 21st - **four day submission process** (*this is a very simple app, so the review time could vary based on size*).

I was learning design at [the Creative Circus](http://www.creativecircus.edu/) when this revolutionary device was released into this world. At that time, I had no real experience in development past playing with iWeb and Dreamweaver. I smile to myself when I think of where I started, and the journey I have been on. As I slowly found my way as a developer, I never lost my love for design. So when I chose to build iOS apps, I made a very important rule for myself.\n\n> Build apps that make the world better through beautiful UI/UX design.\n\nWhen I finally decided to build my first personal app, I new it had to involve design and a simpler way of doing something already out there. I love logo design and my go to Mac app is [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). But what about when I am away from my computer and have time to kill, or how about when I am meeting a client without my laptop? Well, there should be an app for that... and I didn't like a single one of them. I remembered a simple Javascript web app, called Liltool, I had built that would allow you to draw layers, color, etc.\n\n### Learning\n\nI had recently gone through the [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) iOS Bootcamp, which [Hybrid](http://www.meethybrid.com/) had sent me to become a better iOS developer. First off, BNR is an awesome program and it very well sparked a new fire within me to build apps. Learning from a human rather than online tutorials is a million times more effective and efficient. A week of training fixed what I had been learning wrong for the year or more before that.\n\n### Problem\n\nMy belief is that an app should have a purpose or a problem to solve. My problem was having a simple way to create [vector graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) on my iPhone or iPad. I spent a good amount of time researching other apps that do this and found what I personally didn't like and noted how they could be better.\n\n### Birth\n\nLate at night, 3 hours at a time, for over 3 months I slowly pieced together version 1.0 of [Liltool](http://liltool.com/) for iOS. I made my process into a game, giving myself key stages to conquer. Every time another piece of the app was completed, I felt more relaxed and more enthusiastic. Finally I was happy and submitted it to the App Store... couple weeks passed and I started to get nervous. Could I have built an awful app, are they laughing at it as they review it, will I be rejected?\n\nStatus Update, you app is being processed for the App Store. Relief flooded over me, then it hit me... my app is accepted! I am now an approved app developer. Not by some lame fart app, but by an advanced drawing tool that will help others.\n\n### Rebirth\n\nIt has been a long time coming, but I finally found time to update my [Liltool App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liltool/id579943396?mt=8). With iOS 7 redesign, came a renewed excitement about how Liltool could look and work even better. Spent time on fixing any bad conventions from the previous version and even more time to redesign the UI/UX.\n\n### Future\n\nThere are many more features I want to add to Liltool, and I will always be working to make what I have created better. You can suggest ideas or bugs you find on [Github](https://github.com/joalbright/Liltool-App/issues).\n\nNow it is my time to teach others about iOS app development. Check out my [Mobile Engineering](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/) class at The Iron Yard.\n\n\n### Comparison\n\nversion 1.0\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![version 1.0 icon](/content/images/2014/Feb/app_icon_1024.png)\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"screen_shots\">\n![version 1.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/default_568h_2x.png)\n![version 1.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/iOS_Simulator_Screen_shot_Dec_16__2012_9_32_31_AM.png)\n![version 1.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/iOS_Simulator_Screen_shot_Dec_16__2012_9_32_41_AM.png)\n</div>\n\nversion 2.0\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![version 2.0 icon](/content/images/2014/Feb/app_icon_1024-1.png)\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"screen_shots\">\n![version 2.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/Default_568h_2x.png)\n![version 2.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/iOS_Simulator_Screen_shot_Jan_27__2014__4_05_50_PM.png)\n![version 2.0 screenshot](/content/images/2014/Feb/iOS_Simulator_Screen_shot_Jan_27__2014__12_48_19_PM.png)\n</div>\n\n<style>\nimg { max-width: 150px; }\n.screen_shots img { max-width: 30%; display:inline-block; }\n.icon img { width:80px; border-radius:21px; border: 1px solid #eee;  display:inline; }\n</style>","html":"<p>As a tech nerd, I fell in love with the iPhone right away.

So when I chose to build iOS apps, I made a very important rule for myself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Build apps that make the world better through beautiful UI/UX design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I finally decided to build my first personal app, I new it had to involve design and a simpler way of doing something already out there. I love logo design and my go to Mac app is <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html\">Adobe Illustrator</a>. But what about when I am away from my computer and have time to kill, or how about when I am meeting a client without my laptop? Well, there should be an app for that... and I didn't like a single one of them. I remembered a simple Javascript web app, called Liltool, I had built that would allow you to draw layers, color, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learning\">Learning</h3>\n\n<p>I had recently gone through the <a href=\"http://www.bignerdranch.com/\">Big Nerd Ranch</a> iOS Bootcamp, which <a href=\"http://www.meethybrid.com/\">Hybrid</a> had sent me to become a better iOS developer. First off, BNR is an awesome program and it very well sparked a new fire within me to build apps. Learning from a human rather than online tutorials is a million times more effective and efficient. A week of training fixed what I had been learning wrong for the year or more before that.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"problem\">Problem</h3>\n\n<p>My belief is that an app should have a purpose or a problem to solve. My problem was having a simple way to create <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics\">vector graphics</a> on my iPhone or iPad. I spent a good amount of time researching other apps that do this and found what I personally didn't like and noted how they could be better.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"birth\">Birth</h3>\n\n<p>Late at night, 3 hours at a time, for over 3 months I slowly pieced together version 1.0 of <a href=\"http://liltool.com/\">Liltool</a> for iOS. I made my process into a game, giving myself key stages to conquer. Every time another piece of the app was completed, I felt more relaxed and more enthusiastic. Finally I was happy and submitted it to the App Store... couple weeks passed and I started to get nervous. Could I have built an awful app, are they laughing at it as they review it, will I be rejected?</p>\n\n<p>Status Update, you app is being processed for the App Store. Relief flooded over me, then it hit me... my app is accepted! I am now an approved app developer. Not by some lame fart app, but by an advanced drawing tool that will help others.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rebirth\">Rebirth</h3>\n\n<p>It has been a long time coming, but I finally found time to update my <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liltool/id579943396?mt=8\">Liltool App</a>. With iOS 7 redesign, came a renewed excitement about how Liltool could look and work even better. Spent time on fixing any bad conventions from the previous version and even more time to redesign the UI/UX.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"future\">Future</h3>\n\n<p>There are many more features I want to add to Liltool, and I will always be working to make what I have created better. You can suggest ideas or bugs you find on <a href=\"https://github.com/joalbright/Liltool-App/issues\">Github</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now it is my time to teach others about iOS app development.

What most people do not know about me is that I am a [gamer](http://steamcommunity.com/id/redleader-jo/games?tab=all). And one of my habits is to constantly download (sometimes buy) games or apps on my iPhone & iPad that I believe will have good user experiences and/or great story lines.\n\n> To be a game developer, you must play games to understand what a gamer gets out of playing them. \n\nNow that games are more presentable to the main stream audience through mobile apps, it is easier to discover what users get from playing them. \n\nA few of the ones that are special to me are :\n\n- Advancement : Time spent in the game is accruing worth and is meaningful.\n- Entertainment : Story lines and new ideas excite the user's imagination.\n- Quick Fix : A moment of boredom averted by a game that can be played in a few minutes.\n\nAs I thought about the contest, I decided this app will easily be a \"Quick Fix\"... but I also wanted it to show past games and overall stats to give a feel of worth. And the designer side of me wanted the game to be playful and pleasing to the eye.\n\nNext steps?\n\n### Design & Story\n\nAll of my ideas start with design, and I thrive on having a good vision of the end product before I move on to development. I tend to consistently question my ideas to expand on them, but also filter out bad any ideas.\n\n- What will be fun and simple to understand?\n\t- With X's & O's being obvious, I decided to use colors. This created a new world for the user right away.\n- How will the user play? Computer or another person?\n\t- I knew playing against another person is standard and the simple to implement, so I decided to push myself and create a robot.\n- What happens to past games?\n\t- I personally enjoy seeing my history and one of my favorite parts of Treehouse's setup is their point system. So stats and potentially showing past games were on the top of my list.\n\nSince we only had a week to build the app, I chose not to build a story for it. Instead, I figured I could play up the robot as a character rather than a computer program.\n\nToDo :\n\n- Create a robot character & its AI\n- Change between play styles\n- View stats of game play\n- Scroll through past games to see how they were won\n- Design that is simple to use & learn as well as animate\n- Highlight who won or stalemate\n- Ability to start new game\n\nFor the design, I was thinking about the circles from the keypad on the lock screen from iOS 7. You can't get any closer to making something understandable than using key elements from the core design. I almost went with red and blue as a color theme, but again this is another obvious choice. Seeing that red and green are compliments, I just needed to pick some tints that were playful.\n\n<div class=\"screen_shots\">\n![Game Play](https://copy.com/fy3CYLuhsiNbM7ew)\n![Win](https://copy.com/PkrDC6GU9wyYBwDE)\n![Stats](https://copy.com/aiAdD1WumV4Elf2H)\n</div>\n\n### Architecture\n\nWhy do you design before architecting the code?\n\nOne of my skills as a hybrid (designer / developer) is the ability to imagine an app in a visual way. So most of my design is created by understanding the structure of how an app can be built. \n\nFirst draft outline of needs :\n\n- Game Collection\n\t- Game\n    \t- Spot Choices\n        - Winner\n- Play State\n\t- Robot : Runs a decision method to chose a spot\n    - Person\n- Touches\n\t- New Game : Add a game to the game collection\n    - Spot Tap : Change which player's turn it is\n    - Stats Tap : Overlay with current totals\n    - Play State : Change who you are playing\n\nMany of my apps are built from code only, without touching Interface Builder (which baffles lots of people). But to me Interface Builder does one thing great, gives a visual experience to someone who can't visualize the app through code.\n\nNext I like to build out the Xcode environment for me to easily navigate my classes and resources. I like to group things as they are contained within other elements, allowing me to go deeper as I need.\n\nBelow is an example of how I tend to layout my groups :\n\n- Models (can hold singletons or data objects)\n- Random (filled with classes I build for all apps normally)\n- Controllers\n\t- Views\n    - TableCells\n- Images (now controlled by [Asset Catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-image_catalog-1.0/Recipe.html))\n\n### Code & Discovery\n\n>Never go into building an app believing you know every angle. \n\nYou will quickly find things that collide or could be done better, and sometimes you might even discover new features you want to implement.\n\nOnce I have an idea of my structure, I will start building top level classes that will manage most of my elements. For this project I built a singleton to manage my games, allowing me to have access to the games anywhere in the app. \n\nFor simplicity and speed I made the game model a mutable dictionary with the spots set to empty :\n\n\tNSMutableDicitionary *game = [@{@1:@2,etc} mutableCopy];\n    \n    // the key @1 is the spot position\n    // the value @2 defines it to be empty (as a user selects a spot it will become @0 for red and @1 for green)\n    // once the game is won a new key @\"winner\" will be added with a @0 or @1 depending on who won\n    \nThis could be so much more advanced by creating a specific class for the game model and having properties to set the winner and spots (thinking about it now, I might upgrade this later). Once I decided upon all of the other pieces like how to save whose turn it is, I moved on to the view portion.\n\nI had a vision of a vertical cover flow animation to swipe through past games. Personally I like controlling every aspect of an app that I can, so instead of trying to find a plugin to make this work, I broke it apart and built parts of it as I went. The [UITableView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html) is basically setup for what I was wanting where each cell could be a game. I set the cell to the screen height and enabled pagination, which took care of the main factors. The tricky part came with trying to animate the games in a cover flow fashion. I ran into a few bumps with the animation of the cells based on the scroll position.\n\n- [CGAffineTransform](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGAffineTransform/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CGAffineTransformMakeScale) : became a huge pain because the cell.transform was acting funny when the scrollview.contentOffset changed (most likely I had unaccounted for some factor).\n- [CATransform3D](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreAnimation_functions/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CATransform3DScale) : is what I ended up using and attaching it to the cell.layer.transform, and it worked flawlessly after that.\n\nDon't give up if something does not work the way you expect it to. There will be cases where something that worked in one instance does not work this time. I have never removed a feature from being unable to make it work.\n\nWith animations working and the tableview filling with game cells, next I needed to deal with touching spots and starting a new game. There wil be times when you need a child object to speak to its parent. The best and most structured way of doing this is through [delegates and protocols](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html). Think of this as a contract between objects that specifies what can be communicated between them. I have used this method for sending data, calling events, handling callbacks, and more. For this setup, I have it handling the turns played and game won.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence\n\nYou created an intelligent robot?\n\nNo, not really. It is funny how ominous AI can sound, and make you look really cool when you build one. But really AI is just code and clockwork with a little bit of random thrown in.\n\nThe main functions of my AI :\n\n- Check for a winning move : it looks over every possible set of three and sees if two spots are occupied by the robot\n- Check for a blocking move : same as above but looking for two spots occupied by the user\n- Random open spot: this is the real special sauce that creates variety for the game play (and honestly it has allowed the robot to beat me multiple times)\n\nSo are AIs hard to build? Nah. Just need to break them apart like any other puzzle and start on one piece at a time. In this case, I didn't realize how great it would turn out until I started playing against it.\n\n### Learn\n\nI learned that building a game app is no different than any other type of app. It just has a little extra flare, some goals, and a story thrown in. Don't be scared to build a game, because they are currently the most profitable apps in the App Store.\n\n*What kind of game would you build?* \n\n**Maybe you should first ask yourself, what kind of games would you play?**\n\nGood luck!\n\n<style>\nimg { max-width: 150px; }\n.screen_shots img { max-width: 30%; display:inline-block; }\n.icon img { width:80px; border-radius:21px; border: 1px solid #eee;  display:inline; }\n</style>","html":"<p>A little over a week ago, <a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/\">Team Treehouse</a> presented a contest to <a href=\"https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/forum-contest-tictactoe-app-for-ios\">build a Tic Tac Toe iOS app</a>. What most people do not know about me is that I am a <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redleader-jo/games?tab=all\">gamer</a>. And one of my habits is to constantly download (sometimes buy) games or apps on my iPhone &amp; iPad that I believe will have good user experiences and/or great story lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To be a game developer, you must play games to understand what a gamer gets out of playing them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that games are more presentable to the main stream audience through mobile apps, it is easier to discover what users get from playing them. </p>\n\n<p>A few of the ones that are special to me are :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Advancement : Time spent in the game is accruing worth and is meaningful.</li>\n<li>Entertainment : Story lines and new ideas excite the user's imagination.</li>\n<li>Quick Fix : A moment of boredom averted by a game that can be played in a few minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As I thought about the contest, I decided this app will easily be a \"Quick Fix\"... but I also wanted it to show past games and overall stats to give a feel of worth. And the designer side of me wanted the game to be playful and pleasing to the eye.</p>\n\n<p>Next steps?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"designstory\">Design &amp; Story</h3>\n\n<p>All of my ideas start with design, and I thrive on having a good vision of the end product before I move on to development. I tend to consistently question my ideas to expand on them, but also filter out bad any ideas.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What will be fun and simple to understand?\n<ul><li>With X's &amp; O's being obvious, I decided to use colors. This created a new world for the user right away.</li></ul></li>\n<li>How will the user play? Computer or another person?\n<ul><li>I knew playing against another person is standard and the simple to implement, so I decided to push myself and create a robot.</li></ul></li>\n<li>What happens to past games?\n<ul><li>I personally enjoy seeing my history and one of my favorite parts of Treehouse's setup is their point system. So stats and potentially showing past games were on the top of my list.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since we only had a week to build the app, I chose not to build a story for it. Instead, I figured I could play up the robot as a character rather than a computer program.</p>\n\n<p>ToDo :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a robot character &amp; its AI</li>\n<li>Change between play styles</li>\n<li>View stats of game play</li>\n<li>Scroll through past games to see how they were won</li>\n<li>Design that is simple to use &amp; learn as well as animate</li>\n<li>Highlight who won or stalemate</li>\n<li>Ability to start new game</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the design, I was thinking about the circles from the keypad on the lock screen from iOS 7. You can't get any closer to making something understandable than using key elements from the core design. I almost went with red and blue as a color theme, but again this is another obvious choice. Seeing that red and green are compliments, I just needed to pick some tints that were playful.</p>\n\n<div class=\"screen_shots\">  \n<img src=\"https://copy.com/fy3CYLuhsiNbM7ew\" alt=\"Game Play\" />\n<img src=\"https://copy.com/PkrDC6GU9wyYBwDE\" alt=\"Win\" />\n<img src=\"https://copy.com/aiAdD1WumV4Elf2H\" alt=\"Stats\" />\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>Why do you design before architecting the code?</p>\n\n<p>One of my skills as a hybrid (designer / developer) is the ability to imagine an app in a visual way. So most of my design is created by understanding the structure of how an app can be built. </p>\n\n<p>First draft outline of needs :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Game Collection\n<ul><li>Game\n<ul><li>Spot Choices</li>\n<li>Winner</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>Play State\n<ul><li>Robot : Runs a decision method to chose a spot</li>\n<li>Person</li></ul></li>\n<li>Touches\n<ul><li>New Game : Add a game to the game collection</li>\n<li>Spot Tap : Change which player's turn it is</li>\n<li>Stats Tap : Overlay with current totals</li>\n<li>Play State : Change who you are playing</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many of my apps are built from code only, without touching Interface Builder (which baffles lots of people). But to me Interface Builder does one thing great, gives a visual experience to someone who can't visualize the app through code.</p>\n\n<p>Next I like to build out the Xcode environment for me to easily navigate my classes and resources. I like to group things as they are contained within other elements, allowing me to go deeper as I need.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an example of how I tend to layout my groups :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Models (can hold singletons or data objects)</li>\n<li>Random (filled with classes I build for all apps normally)</li>\n<li>Controllers\n<ul><li>Views</li>\n<li>TableCells</li></ul></li>\n<li>Images (now controlled by <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-image_catalog-1.0/Recipe.html\">Asset Catalogs</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"codediscovery\">Code &amp; Discovery</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Never go into building an app believing you know every angle. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You will quickly find things that collide or could be done better, and sometimes you might even discover new features you want to implement.</p>\n\n<p>Once I have an idea of my structure, I will start building top level classes that will manage most of my elements. For this project I built a singleton to manage my games, allowing me to have access to the games anywhere in the app. </p>\n\n<p>For simplicity and speed I made the game model a mutable dictionary with the spots set to empty :</p>\n\n<pre><code>NSMutableDicitionary *game = [@{@1:@2,etc} mutableCopy];\n\n// the key @1 is the spot position\n// the value @2 defines it to be empty (as a user selects a spot it will become @0 for red and @1 for green)\n// once the game is won a new key @\"winner\" will be added with a @0 or @1 depending on who won\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This could be so much more advanced by creating a specific class for the game model and having properties to set the winner and spots (thinking about it now, I might upgrade this later). Once I decided upon all of the other pieces like how to save whose turn it is, I moved on to the view portion.</p>\n\n<p>I had a vision of a vertical cover flow animation to swipe through past games. Personally I like controlling every aspect of an app that I can, so instead of trying to find a plugin to make this work, I broke it apart and built parts of it as I went. The <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html\">UITableView</a> is basically setup for what I was wanting where each cell could be a game. I set the cell to the screen height and enabled pagination, which took care of the main factors. The tricky part came with trying to animate the games in a cover flow fashion. I ran into a few bumps with the animation of the cells based on the scroll position.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGAffineTransform/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CGAffineTransformMakeScale\">CGAffineTransform</a> : became a huge pain because the cell.transform was acting funny when the scrollview.contentOffset changed (most likely I had unaccounted for some factor).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreAnimation_functions/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CATransform3DScale\">CATransform3D</a> : is what I ended up using and attaching it to the cell.layer.transform, and it worked flawlessly after that.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Don't give up if something does not work the way you expect it to.

It was the day I had been waiting for to arrive for three months and it was finally here. This group of people that came into the class with no previous knowledge of code, walked head raised high having built their own apps. [Demo Day](http://atlanta.theironyard.com/demo-day-recap/) was just a peak under the covers of what they had experienced as each one of them presented their final app. \n\nBut I have plenty of extra words I wanted to add to their presentations and character of each of the graduates in my class.\n\n## Apps & Their Creators\n\n*Apps listed alphabetically*\n\n### Battle.Tag <small> by Austin Nolan</small>\n\nLocation based gaming is an area that I am very interested in. So when Austin pitched this idea to me for his final app, I couldn't say yes fast enough. The first version of this app allows users to drop mines at different geo locations and other users will lose points when they step on them. He also has a lot of other ideas including missiles and guns to add to the game. Austin does a great job at taking simple functionality and giving it a fun twist.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Battle.Tag](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-1.png)\n</div> \n\n**Coming Soon** | ~~Download on the App Store~~\n\n### BBQ4U <small> by Ashby Thornwell</small>\n\nKnowing your BBQ is very important especially when you are craving a specific kind. But finding the restaurant that has the type of BBQ you are looking for is not that easy. Ashby came up with a great idea of choosing the type of BBQ you want to find the restaurant that has what you are looking for. This app constantly makes me hungry. Ashby always has a smile on her face, even when the code gets frustrating.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![BBQ4U](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-2.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbq-4-u/id883250332?mt=8)\n\n### Box Tagger <small> by Austen Johnson</small>\n\nLooking for that item you packed away and just can't figure out where you packed it... That probably means you weren't using Box Tagger. This app allows you to find items in a specific box or find the box that has the item you are looking for. Austen has a talent of winning even when the odds are against him. Oh, also watch for a really cool Roshambo app he has in the works.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Box Tagger](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-3.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/box-tagger/id889283149?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### Game Chest <small> by Heidi Proske</small>\n\nGames, animations, and a ton of colors. This app is starting with 3 games : Dots & Dashes, Square Memory Cards, and a Whack-a-Mole type Circle game. Heidi has built in some very fluid and intuitive user experience into this app. Simple gestures and hitting the side of the phone opens up so much functionality. Heidi is always making sure everything is dynamic, which is great for how much she tests and perfects her apps.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Game Chest](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-4.png)\n</div>\n\n**Coming Soon** | ~~Download on the App Store~~\n\n### Hit The Books <small> by Jeffery Moulds</small>\n\nThis is an app I honestly did not think was going to happen when he first pitched it to me. It is a very complicated setup mixing two games together and building multiple interactions across both parts of the app. This is a breakout type game mixed with a guess the word game, where random letters will appear from broken bricks. The user has to guess the word before all letters are revealed. Great educational game to peak kids interest in learning how to spell words. Jeffery has a knack for coming up with random app ideas.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Hit The Books](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-5.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-the-books/id883248468?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### HoneyDo <small> by Jisha Obukwelu</small>\n\nThis is such a funny app idea to me. This app says \"My man is whipped\". Hahaha. Seriously though, this is a cool idea of using notifications to update your spouse's app with items to do. Jisha has an awesome drive to figure things out. She is also apart of a team that got asked by Coke to finish out an app they came up with at a hackathon.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![HoneyDo](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-11.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hunnydo-honeydo/id883249854?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### MIO <small> by Ali Houshmand</small>\n\nAli came from a background in finance and principal investing (real estate). He took a problem from his previous occupation and found a way to solve it with an iOS app. **MIO** *(aka : move in & out)* is an app that makes it easier for people to manage rental properties as tenants move in or out. He pushed this app much further than he imagined he could. Ali has a very strong will that keeps him from giving up, and does not fear learning new things.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![MIO](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-6.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mio-move-in-out/id883248598?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### Occupants <small> by Derek Weber</small>\n\nThis app allows bar owners the ability to know what their target audience is per night. He has also built in a Parse backend that will allow this service to grow so that it will meet the end user's desire to know what bars are hopping. Derek is quiet and calculating, and has some really big ideas.\n\n*I believe that there was a simple issue with the app submission, but it should be on the App Store soon.*\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Occupants](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-7.png)\n</div>\n\n**Coming Soon** | ~~Download on the App Store~~\n\n### Piano ♪ Says <small> by Jon Fox</small>\n\nThis app makes me smile so much. Jon was a sound engineer previously, and has a passion for audio. He took the idea of the piano app and advanced it by adding a memory game to teach users how to play different songs. Great for kids wanting to learn piano in a fun way. Jon is the most improved from this course. He has a great self starter mentality, and he took the 12 weeks to push himself way further than he was taught in this class.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Piano ♪ Says](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-10.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piano-says/id889660366?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### Sanctuary <small> by Ed Salter</small>\n\nThis is an app that I got really excited about. I love the idea of seeing noise based on location, allowing a user to find a quiet place to work. Ed  pushed farther than I could have taught him, while trying to figure out how to make this work using the different audio frameworks. Ed is someone you can ask him to figure it out and he always will without fail.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Sanctuary](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-8.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sanctuary-map/id895339010?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### ShopPING <small> by Savitha Reddy</small>\n\nEveryone should download this app if you plan on shopping and need to ask someone if they want anything from the store. This app notifies family members that someone has started shopping and asks if they want to add anything to the list. The person shopping gets notified as family members add items. Savitha is very quiet when you first meet her, but as she warms up to you she reveals how excited she can get about what she creates.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![ShopPING](/content/images/2014/Jul/ICON.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shop.ping/id891169328?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n### Tweet Alarm <small> by John Yam</small>\n\nAlarms never seem to work for me... I am always turning them off or just not hearing them. But this is a twist on the normal alarm clock. When a user sets an alarm, they also set the text that will get tweeted out when the alarm goes off. This is such an interesting use of new technology with old functionality. John is not only a developer, but is also a designer. His ability to design and develop beautiful user interfaces will always amaze.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Tweet Alarm](/content/images/2014/Jul/tweetclock-logo-white.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-alarm/id891423626?mt=8)\n\n### Writer Blocks <small> by TJ Mercer</small>\n\nThis is a great app for helping build a story outline. Having built story outlines before, TJ knew exactly what he wanted to solve with this app. Every time I checked in with him, he had added another feature to it. TJ was constantly pushing and is a very quick learner. He is going to be someone to watch as he continues to push more apps out.\n\n<div class=\"icon\">\n![Writer Blocks](/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-9.png)\n</div>\n\n[Download on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writer-blocks/id893807282?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n<style>\n.icon { border-radius: 18px; }\n.icon .image-uploader, .icon .pre-image-uploader { max-width: 82px; margin: 0px; border-radius: 18px; }\n.icon img { max-width: 80px; border-radius: 18px;  border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 0; }\nh3 small { font-size: 20px; color: #999; }\n</style>\n\n## What next?\n\nThis was an awesome group that can now call themselves developers. I am proud to have grown my community of developers with people I can call friends.\n\nAs I say goodbye to that class, I start a new [class in just a few days](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/). It's exciting to know that this gets to happen all over again.

Ashby came up with a great idea of choosing the type of BBQ you want to find the restaurant that has what you are looking for. This app constantly makes me hungry. Ashby always has a smile on her face, even when the code gets frustrating.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-2.png\" alt=\"BBQ4U\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbq-4-u/id883250332?mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boxtaggersmallbyaustenjohnsonsmall\">Box Tagger <small> by Austen Johnson</small></h3>\n\n<p>Looking for that item you packed away and just can't figure out where you packed it... That probably means you weren't using Box Tagger. This app allows you to find items in a specific box or find the box that has the item you are looking for. Austen has a talent of winning even when the odds are against him. Oh, also watch for a really cool Roshambo app he has in the works.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-3.png\" alt=\"Box Tagger\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/box-tagger/id889283149?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gamechestsmallbyheidiproskesmall\">Game Chest <small> by Heidi Proske</small></h3>\n\n<p>Games, animations, and a ton of colors. This app is starting with 3 games : Dots &amp; Dashes, Square Memory Cards, and a Whack-a-Mole type Circle game. Heidi has built in some very fluid and intuitive user experience into this app. Simple gestures and hitting the side of the phone opens up so much functionality. Heidi is always making sure everything is dynamic, which is great for how much she tests and perfects her apps.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-4.png\" alt=\"Game Chest\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong> | <del>Download on the App Store</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hitthebookssmallbyjefferymouldssmall\">Hit The Books <small> by Jeffery Moulds</small></h3>\n\n<p>This is an app I honestly did not think was going to happen when he first pitched it to me. It is a very complicated setup mixing two games together and building multiple interactions across both parts of the app. This is a breakout type game mixed with a guess the word game, where random letters will appear from broken bricks. The user has to guess the word before all letters are revealed. Great educational game to peak kids interest in learning how to spell words. Jeffery has a knack for coming up with random app ideas.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-5.png\" alt=\"Hit The Books\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-the-books/id883248468?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"honeydosmallbyjishaobukwelusmall\">HoneyDo <small> by Jisha Obukwelu</small></h3>\n\n<p>This is such a funny app idea to me. This app says \"My man is whipped\". Hahaha. Seriously though, this is a cool idea of using notifications to update your spouse's app with items to do. Jisha has an awesome drive to figure things out. She is also apart of a team that got asked by Coke to finish out an app they came up with at a hackathon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-11.png\" alt=\"HoneyDo\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hunnydo-honeydo/id883249854?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"miosmallbyalihoushmandsmall\">MIO <small> by Ali Houshmand</small></h3>\n\n<p>Ali came from a background in finance and principal investing (real estate). He took a problem from his previous occupation and found a way to solve it with an iOS app. <strong>MIO</strong> <em>(aka : move in &amp; out)</em> is an app that makes it easier for people to manage rental properties as tenants move in or out. He pushed this app much further than he imagined he could. Ali has a very strong will that keeps him from giving up, and does not fear learning new things.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-6.png\" alt=\"MIO\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mio-move-in-out/id883248598?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"occupantssmallbyderekwebersmall\">Occupants <small> by Derek Weber</small></h3>\n\n<p>This app allows bar owners the ability to know what their target audience is per night. He has also built in a Parse backend that will allow this service to grow so that it will meet the end user's desire to know what bars are hopping. Derek is quiet and calculating, and has some really big ideas.</p>\n\n<p><em>I believe that there was a simple issue with the app submission, but it should be on the App Store soon.</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-7.png\" alt=\"Occupants\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Coming Soon</strong> | <del>Download on the App Store</del></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pianosayssmallbyjonfoxsmall\">Piano ♪ Says <small> by Jon Fox</small></h3>\n\n<p>This app makes me smile so much. Jon was a sound engineer previously, and has a passion for audio. He took the idea of the piano app and advanced it by adding a memory game to teach users how to play different songs. Great for kids wanting to learn piano in a fun way. Jon is the most improved from this course. He has a great self starter mentality, and he took the 12 weeks to push himself way further than he was taught in this class.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-10.png\" alt=\"Piano ♪ Says\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/piano-says/id889660366?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sanctuarysmallbyedsaltersmall\">Sanctuary <small> by Ed Salter</small></h3>\n\n<p>This is an app that I got really excited about. I love the idea of seeing noise based on location, allowing a user to find a quiet place to work. Ed  pushed farther than I could have taught him, while trying to figure out how to make this work using the different audio frameworks. Ed is someone you can ask him to figure it out and he always will without fail.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-8.png\" alt=\"Sanctuary\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sanctuary-map/id895339010?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"shoppingsmallbysavithareddysmall\">ShopPING <small> by Savitha Reddy</small></h3>\n\n<p>Everyone should download this app if you plan on shopping and need to ask someone if they want anything from the store. This app notifies family members that someone has started shopping and asks if they want to add anything to the list. The person shopping gets notified as family members add items. Savitha is very quiet when you first meet her, but as she warms up to you she reveals how excited she can get about what she creates.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/ICON.png\" alt=\"ShopPING\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shop.ping/id891169328?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tweetalarmsmallbyjohnyamsmall\">Tweet Alarm <small> by John Yam</small></h3>\n\n<p>Alarms never seem to work for me... I am always turning them off or just not hearing them. But this is a twist on the normal alarm clock. When a user sets an alarm, they also set the text that will get tweeted out when the alarm goes off. This is such an interesting use of new technology with old functionality. John is not only a developer, but is also a designer. His ability to design and develop beautiful user interfaces will always amaze.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/tweetclock-logo-white.png\" alt=\"Tweet Alarm\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-alarm/id891423626?mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"writerblockssmallbytjmercersmall\">Writer Blocks <small> by TJ Mercer</small></h3>\n\n<p>This is a great app for helping build a story outline. Having built story outlines before, TJ knew exactly what he wanted to solve with this app. Every time I checked in with him, he had added another feature to it. TJ was constantly pushing and is a very quick learner. He is going to be someone to watch as he continues to push more apps out.</p>\n\n<div class=\"icon\">  \n<img src=\"/content/images/2014/Jul/icon-9.png\" alt=\"Writer Blocks\" />\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writer-blocks/id893807282?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">Download on the App Store</a></p>\n\n<style>  \n.icon { border-radius: 18px; }\n.icon .image-uploader, .icon .pre-image-uploader { max-width: 82px; margin: 0px; border-radius: 18px; }\n.icon img { max-width: 80px; border-radius: 18px;  border: 1px solid #ddd; margin: 0; }\nh3 small { font-size: 20px; color: #999; }  \n</style>\n\n<h2 id=\"whatnext\">What next?</h2>\n\n<p>This was an awesome group that can now call themselves developers.
