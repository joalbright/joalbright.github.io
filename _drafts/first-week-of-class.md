title: First Week of Class
---

You know how people spend so much time preparing for something that almost always ends up not going as planned? Well I went the opposite route. I chose to have a very basic outline, with nothing planned at all. 

This is where you say. **"Wait, what?"**

Yes, that is what I did for the first week of this class. I chose to wake up everyday and spend 30 minutes or so just outlining in my head the parts of an app that are neccesary to know when building. Each day I would build upon what I taught the day before. But, that isn't even the best part.

> I made them build an app on the first day, without explaining to them how they did it.
