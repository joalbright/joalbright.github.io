I would be understating my feelings of excitement on the last day of my first iOS course at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com/), by saying I was as giddy as a kid on Christmas morning. It was the day I had been waiting for to arrive for three months and it was finally here. This group of people that came into the class with no previous knowledge of code, walked head raised high having built their own apps. [Demo Day](http://atlanta.theironyard.com/demo-day-recap/) was just a peak under the covers of what they had experienced as each one of them presented their final app. 

But I have plenty of extra words I wanted to add to their presentations and character of each of the graduates in my class.

## Apps & Their Creators

*Apps listed alphabetically*

### Battle.Tag <small> by Austin Nolan</small>

Location based gaming is an area that I am very interested in. So when Austin pitched this idea to me for his final app, I couldn't say yes fast enough. The first version of this app allows users to drop mines at different geo locations and other users will lose points when they step on them. He also has a lot of other ideas including missiles and guns to add to the game. Austin does a great job at taking simple functionality and giving it a fun twist.

### BBQ4U <small> by Ashby Thornwell</small>

Knowing your BBQ is very important especially when you are craving a specific kind. But finding the restaurant that has the type of BBQ you are looking for is not that easy. Ashby came up with a great idea of choosing the type of BBQ you want to find the restaurant that has what you are looking for. This app constantly makes me hungry. Ashby always has a smile on her face, even when the code gets frustrating.

### Box Tagger <small> by Austen Johnson</small>

Looking for that item you packed away and just can't figure out where you packed it... That probably means you weren't using Box Tagger. This app allows you to find items in a specific box or find the box that has the item you are looking for. Austen has a talent of winning even when the odds are against him. Oh, also watch for a really cool Roshambo app he has in the works.

### Game Chest <small> by Heidi Proske</small>

Games, animations, and a ton of colors. This app is starting with 3 games : Dots & Dashes, Square Memory Cards, and a Whack-a-Mole type Circle game. Heidi has built in some very fluid and intuitive user experience into this app. Simple gestures and hitting the side of the phone opens up so much functionality. Heidi is always making sure everything is dynamic, which is great for how much she tests and perfects her apps.

### Hit The Books <small> by Jeffery Moulds</small>

This is an app I honestly did not think was going to happen when he first pitched it to me. It is a very complicated setup mixing two games together and building multiple interactions across both parts of the app. This is a breakout type game mixed with a guess the word game, where random letters will appear from broken bricks. The user has to guess the word before all letters are revealed. Great educational game to peak kids interest in learning how to spell words. Jeffery has a knack for coming up with random app ideas.

### HoneyDo <small> by Jisha Obukwelu</small>

This is such a funny app idea to me. This app says "My man is whipped". Hahaha. Seriously though, this is a cool idea of using notifications to update your spouse's app with items to do. Jisha has an awesome drive to figure things out. She is also apart of a team that got asked by Coke to finish out an app they came up with at a hackathon.

### MIO <small> by Ali Houshmand</small>

Ali came from a background in finance and principal investing (real estate). He took a problem from his previous occupation and found a way to solve it with an iOS app. **MIO** *(aka : move in & out)* is an app that makes it easier for people to manage rental properties as tenants move in or out. He pushed this app much further than he imagined he could. Ali has a very strong will that keeps him from giving up, and does not fear learning new things.

### Occupants <small> by Derek Weber</small>

This app allows bar owners the ability to know what their target audience is per night. He has also built in a Parse backend that will allow this service to grow so that it will meet the end user's desire to know what bars are hopping. Derek is quiet and calculating, and has some really big ideas.

*I believe that there was a simple issue with the app submission, but it should be on the App Store soon.*

### Piano ♪ Says <small> by Jon Fox</small>

This app makes me smile so much. Jon was a sound engineer previously, and has a passion for audio. He took the idea of the piano app and advanced it by adding a memory game to teach users how to play different songs. Great for kids wanting to learn piano in a fun way. Jon is the most improved from this course. He has a great self starter mentality, and he took the 12 weeks to push himself way further than he was taught in this class.

### Sanctuary <small> by Ed Salter</small>

This is an app that I got really excited about. I love the idea of seeing noise based on location, allowing a user to find a quiet place to work. Ed  pushed farther than I could have taught him, while trying to figure out how to make this work using the different audio frameworks. Ed is someone you can ask him to figure it out and he always will without fail.

### ShopPING <small> by Savitha Reddy</small>

Everyone should download this app if you plan on shopping and need to ask someone if they want anything from the store. This app notifies family members that someone has started shopping and asks if they want to add anything to the list. The person shopping gets notified as family members add items. Savitha is very quiet when you first meet her, but as she warms up to you she reveals how excited she can get about what she creates.

### Tweet Alarm <small> by John Yam</small>

Alarms never seem to work for me... I am always turning them off or just not hearing them. But this is a twist on the normal alarm clock. When a user sets an alarm, they also set the text that will get tweeted out when the alarm goes off. This is such an interesting use of new technology with old functionality. John is not only a developer, but is also a designer. His ability to design and develop beautiful user interfaces will always amaze.

### Writer Blocks <small> by TJ Mercer</small>

This is a great app for helping build a story outline. Having built story outlines before, TJ knew exactly what he wanted to solve with this app. Every time I checked in with him, he had added another feature to it. TJ was constantly pushing and is a very quick learner. He is going to be someone to watch as he continues to push more apps out.

## What next?

This was an awesome group that can now call themselves developers. I am proud to have grown my community of developers with people I can call friends.

As I say goodbye to that class, I start a new [class in just a few days](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/). It's exciting to know that this gets to happen all over again. I can't wait to see what apps come from the next cohort.
