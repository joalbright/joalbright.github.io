title: GitHub, A Tool for Mistakes
---

Mistakes are what challenges a developer to be better than they currently are. How you handle what happens after a mistake arises will pave your path as a developer. So why do people fear admitting to mistakes? Why do we chose to tuck them under our pillow and pretend they are not there?

Being in the development field for long enough to see how different people handle mistakes (including myself). It is very easy to take a mistake personally, which allows it to make you feel like you are a poor developer. But the more productive way to look at mistakes is to admit that you missed something or wrote something incorrectly. Doing this not only makes you pay more attention to not repeat the mistake, but it also shows your maturity in handling problems. Admitting the mistake, also allows you to show that you can correct the problem.

### Reasons I Love GitHub

When first using this really awesome versioning service, you will be impressed with the collaboration aspect of it. And yes, I will say that is by far the greatest reasons to use this tool. But as I have used it, I really like some of the other functions of it.
