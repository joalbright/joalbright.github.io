title: Tools for Your Level
---

As a developer, knowing where to go for information based on your skill level is very hard. If you look for information in an area that is above your level, you tend to shy away from progressing or are made to feel bad for being a *noob*.

### Where to Start?

The first place people tend to go is [Google](http://lmgtfy.com/), and I have nothing against that. But, when you get search results back there is no "advanced", "beginner", etc labeling of the links. Leaving a lot of people to go straight for the [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) links, which is normally okay for mid to advanced level developers. But when you are beginning or trying to learn, I would suggest to use online tutorial sites :

- [Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)
- [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/)
- [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)
- [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/)
- [Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/)

The reason I send beginners towards those sites rather than forum based sites, is to protect them from trolls (at least until they can fend for themselves).

### Beware of Trolls 

They don't only live under bridges anymore, they have found prey within forums and comments. The easiest way to be discouraged while learning to code is to be tormented by trolls who have nothing better to do than to look down on people with less knowledge than them. Quick to point and shout **NOOB** at anyone with less experience in a field, these beasts live for the damage they can inflict on others looking for help in the wrong way or area. If you find a troll, stay very still and act like you don't see them. When engaged they will do their best at destroying you, and they are usually very tough to fight.

If you end up in a troll infested site, just move on, they are very easy to avoid.

### Honesty 

When looking for questions anywhere, be honest about your skill level. The more humble you are, the more people will try to take you under their wing and help you out. If you boisterously post code on a site and your conventions are bad or off in any way, people will tear you apart for the smallest mistakes. 

Being humble will also allow you as a developer to be more open to listening to advice and help. Which in turn will increase the speed of your learning.

### Mentoring

Okay, so you have gotten past the beginning stage and are feeling pretty good about your development skills, but you still have a few questions. There are some really great tools to allow for mentoring and support sites :

**Mentoring**

- [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/)
- [Hack Hands](https://hackhands.com/)

**Support**

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
