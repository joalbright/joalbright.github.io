As a tech nerd, I fell in love with the iPhone right away. I was learning design at [the Creative Circus](http://www.creativecircus.edu/) when this revolutionary device was released into this world. At that time, I had no real experience in development past playing with iWeb and Dreamweaver. I smile to myself when I think of where I started, and the journey I have been on. As I slowly found my way as a developer, I never lost my love for design. So when I chose to build iOS apps, I made a very important rule for myself.

> Build apps that make the world better through beautiful UI/UX design.

When I finally decided to build my first personal app, I new it had to involve design and a simpler way of doing something already out there. I love logo design and my go to Mac app is [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). But what about when I am away from my computer and have time to kill, or how about when I am meeting a client without my laptop? Well, there should be an app for that... and I didn't like a single one of them. I remembered a simple Javascript web app, called Liltool, I had built that would allow you to draw layers, color, etc.

### Learning

I had recently gone through the [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) iOS Bootcamp, which [Hybrid](http://www.meethybrid.com/) had sent me to become a better iOS developer. First off, BNR is an awesome program and it very well sparked a new fire within me to build apps. Learning from a human rather than online tutorials is a million times more effective and efficient. A week of training fixed what I had been learning wrong for the year or more before that.

### Problem

My belief is that an app should have a purpose or a problem to solve. My problem was having a simple way to create [vector graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) on my iPhone or iPad. I spent a good amount of time researching other apps that do this and found what I personally didn't like and noted how they could be better.

### Birth

Late at night, 3 hours at a time, for over 3 months I slowly pieced together version 1.0 of [Liltool](http://liltool.com/) for iOS. I made my process into a game, giving myself key stages to conquer. Every time another piece of the app was completed, I felt more relaxed and more enthusiastic. Finally I was happy and submitted it to the App Store... couple weeks passed and I started to get nervous. Could I have built an awful app, are they laughing at it as they review it, will I be rejected?

Status Update, you app is being processed for the App Store. Relief flooded over me, then it hit me... my app is accepted! I am now an approved app developer. Not by some lame fart app, but by an advanced drawing tool that will help others.

### Rebirth

It has been a long time coming, but I finally found time to update my [Liltool App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liltool/id579943396?mt=8). With iOS 7 redesign, came a renewed excitement about how Liltool could look and work even better. Spent time on fixing any bad conventions from the previous version and even more time to redesign the UI/UX.

### Future

There are many more features I want to add to Liltool, and I will always be working to make what I have created better. You can suggest ideas or bugs you find on [Github](https://github.com/joalbright/Liltool-App/issues).

Now it is my time to teach others about iOS app development. Check out my [Mobile Engineering](http://theironyard.com/academy/mobile-engineering/) class at The Iron Yard.
